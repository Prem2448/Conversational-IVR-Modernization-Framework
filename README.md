AI Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework.
This project focuses on modernizing legacy IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems built using VoiceXML (VXML) by integrating them with modern Conversational AI platforms such as Azure Communication Services (ACS) and Bot Application Platform (BAP).

The goal is to enhance user experience, introduce natural language interactions, and reduce the technical burden of maintaining rigid, menu-driven IVR workflows while reusing existing legacy assets.
