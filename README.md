AI Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework.

Abstract:

This project focuses on the modernization of traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems built using VoiceXML (VXML) by integrating them with modern Conversational AI platforms such as Azure Communication Services (ACS) and Bot Application Platform (BAP). The aim is to enhance user experience through natural language interaction while reusing and extending existing legacy IVR assets. This milestone covers the analysis of existing IVR systems, their architecture, workflows, limitations, and the requirements for integrating them with modern AI-driven conversational platforms.

Objectives:


To study the architecture and workflow of legacy IVR systems

To identify limitations of traditional menu-driven IVR platforms

To document integration requirements for ACS and BAP

To analyze technical challenges and compatibility gaps

To define a modernization approach with minimal rework of legacy systems 




Limitations of Legacy IVR:

Rigid and linear menu-based interactions 

Limited natural language understanding

Poor user experience due to deep menu trees

High maintenance cost for VXML updates

Difficult integration with modern AI platforms

Low personalization and adaptability




Integration Requirements (ACS & BAP):

-> Azure Communication Services (ACS): 

Call handling and routing

Media streaming and call control

DTMF support for backward compatibility

Failover and fallback routing



-> Bot Application Platform (BAP):

Conversational dialog orchestration

Intent and entity recognition

Context and session management

Multilingual support

Human agent escalation




Security and Compliance Considerations:

Secure communication between ACS, BAP, and backend systems

Encryption of sensitive customer data

Role-based access control

Logging and audit trails

Compliance with data protection regulations




Expected Benefits:

Improved user experience through conversational AI

Reuse of existing IVR assets

Reduced migration risk

Scalable and maintainable system architecture

Foundation for future multi-channel support
